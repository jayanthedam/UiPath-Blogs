        RPA stands for
        <span class="color_para_org">Robotic Process Automation</span> ,though
        may sound like a lot of complex words joined together, it simply means
        automating the repetitive tasks we may find in our daily routine.
        <br /><br />
        Imagine you have to copy information from one spread sheet to a word
        document every day or send emails to a bunch of people;
        <span class="color_para_blue">RPA can do that for you.</span> It’s
        almost like an actual robot doing the work for you (but instead of a
        physical robot, it is a software robot), hence the name robotic process
        automation.

      <p class="container_para">
        Take an example of sending personalized emails to a bunch of people who
        attended your seminar, an RPA bot can do the same work
        <span class="color_para_org">faster</span>, more efficiently and without
        mistakes. Its like having a helper who never gets tired.
        <br /><br />Companies use RPA in various areas, like processing
        invoices, handling customer queries, or managing data entry tasks.
        Learning RPA is like teaching your computer a few tricks to handle the
        boring stuff, so you can focus on more exciting things!
